Installation

Using Xcode, you can add AudioKit and any of the other AudioKit libraries using Collections

Select File -> Add Packages...
Click the + icon on the bottom left of the Collections sidebar on the left.
Choose Add Swift Package Collection from the pop-up menu.
In the Add Package Collection dialog box, enter https://swiftpackageindex.com/AudioKit/collection.json as the URL and click the "Load" button.
It will warn you that the collection is not signed, but it is fine, click "Add Unsigned Collection".
Now you can add any of the AudioKit Swift Packages you need and read about what they do, right from within Xcode.

Docs appear on the AudioKit.io Web Site. You can also generate the documentation in Xcode by pulling down the Product menu and choosing "Build Documentation".
